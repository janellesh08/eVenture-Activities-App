                We can all agree that boredom is the worst, right? Friends coming over?
                Family in town? At home alone with no idea what to do with yourself? The
                problem is that when we get some of that elusive "free time", we don't really
                have a plan for it. Coming up with fun things to do at the last minute is way
                more difficult than one would expect. You have to consider so many variables
                when planning that it can feel like an arduous task. If you can relate then you've 
                come to the right place!
